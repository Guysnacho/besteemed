# Besteemed

Home of the new Esteemed Woman website

### Next Steps

[ x ] - Change index into huge hero with links
[ x ] - Optimize layout, something is getting in the way of responsive sizing and I don't wanna blame it on myself. Remove in the meantime
[ x ] - Add initiatives (CPR, Esteemed Woman Abroad, Israel Excursions)
[ ] - Add admin side
[ ] - Add forms instead of email redirects
[ ] - Add billing

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Guysnacho/besteemed
cd besteemed
yarn
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
